## 🔍 Cross-Page Patterns: Common HTML Issues

These HTML patterns cause the same accessibility errors across multiple pages. **Fix the pattern once in your codebase to fix it everywhere!**

### 🎯 Top Patterns to Fix (Highest Impact)

#### Pattern 1: Affects 100 page(s) - 200 occurrence(s)

**Scanner**: axe
**Rule**: [meta-refresh](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.11/meta-refresh?application=playwright)
**Impact**: critical
**Issue**: Delayed refresh under 20 hours must not be used

**HTML Pattern**:
```html
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="360">
```

**XPath** (use in browser DevTools):
```
meta[http-equiv="refresh"]
```

**How to Replicate**:
1. Open any affected page in your browser
2. Press F12 to open DevTools
3. Go to Console tab
4. Run: `$x('meta[http-equiv="refresh"]')`
5. The element will be highlighted

**Affected Pages**:
- https://government.se/
- https://government.se/reports/
- https://government.se/government-policy/social-services/
- https://government.se/government-policy/swedens-support-to-ukraine/
- https://government.se/articles/2026/02/four-years-of-war-support-to-ukraine-remains-governments-foremost-foreign-policy-priority/
- *...and 95 more page(s)*

---

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: These patterns likely come from shared components or templates in your codebase. Fix them in the component/template source, and the fix will propagate to all affected pages.
