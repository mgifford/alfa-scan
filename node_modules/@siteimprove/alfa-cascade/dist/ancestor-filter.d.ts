/**
 * The ancestor filter is a data structure used for optimising selector matching
 * in the case of descendant selectors.
 *
 * @remarks
 * When traversing down through the DOM tree during selector matching, the
 * ancestor filter stores information about the ancestor elements that are
 * found up the path from the element that is currently being visited.
 * Given an element and a descendant selector, we can therefore quickly
 * determine if the selector might match an ancestor of the current element.
 *
 * The ancestor filter simply count the number of each ID, class, and type
 * amongst the path walked so far. When a descendant selector is encountered, we
 * can quickly see if the ancestor filter contains the ID, class, or type of the
 * ancestor part, without walking up the full tree again.
 *
 * We need to remember exact count rather than just existence because the
 * initial build of the cascade traverses the tree in depth-first order and
 * therefore needs to be able to *remove* item from the filter when going up.
 *
 * For example, consider the following DOM tree:
 *
 * section#content
 * +-- blockquote
 * +-- p.highlight
 *     +-- b
 *
 * For the `<b>` element, the ancestor filter would be:
 * \{ ids: [["content", 1]],
 *   classes: [["highlight", 1]],
 *   types: [["p", 1], ["section", 1]]\}
 * Given a selector `main b`, we can therefore reject that the selector would
 * match the `<b>` as the ancestor filter does not contain the type `main`.
 *
 * However, given a selector `section.highlight`, the ancestor filter can only
 * tell that it **may** match the `<b>` element. In this case, it doesn't. So,
 * the filter acts as a quick guaranteed rejection mechanism, but actual match
 * test is needed to have an accurate final result.
 *
 * @privateRemarks
 * Ancestor filters are mutable! None of the operations of the ancestor filter
 * are idempotent to avoid keeping track of more information than strictly
 * necessary. This is however not a problem when ancestor filters are used
 * during top-down traversal of the DOM, in which case an element is only ever
 * visited once. If used elsewhere care must however be taken when adding and
 * removing elements; elements must only ever be added and removed once, and
 * an element must not be removed before being added.
