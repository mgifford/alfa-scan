/**
 * @remarks
 * Cascade layer form a tree. They are then ordered in depth-first
 * **suffix** traversal (parent is after children).
 *
 * This means that:
 * 1. The path to two layers is not enough to compare them, we need
 *    the full tree or at least the relative order of children.
 * 2. It is not possible to pre-compute a single number upon declaring
 *    a layer, its actual position depends on the number of descendants
 *    it has.
 * 3. The declaration order of layers is not enough; the order of `foo.bar`
 *    versus `lorem.ipsum` depends on the order of `foo` vs `lorem`, even
 *    if `lorem.ispum` is ultimately declared before `foo.bar`.
 *
 * To solve that, while providing a fast comparison of layers (hence of
 * precedences), we store layers as mutuable objects with a name (their path
 * in the layer tree), and a number (their position in the traversal). Upon
 * building blocks, we can compute the name (and only the name). Once all
 * declarations and rules have been processed, we can revisit the layers in
 * the correct order and give them a number.
 *
 * By using a mutable structure for layers, we can have the cascade Blocks
 * used here refer to them as object and thus updating the order will
 * automatically update it in all blocks, without needing to revisit them.
 *
 * Comparing layers is then just a matter of comparing their order. Layers with
 * normal declarations have negative order, layers with important declaration
 * have positive order (with the same absolute value for the same layer). This
 * account for important declaration winning (this is actually handled by Origin
 * comparison), and reversing the layer order.
 *
 * @privateRemarks
 * This is mutable!
 *
 * Since layers' name are CSS identifiers, they may not contain parenthesis.
 * Thus we may safely use parenthesis in name of "special" layers (anonymous)
 * and implicit), and not treat them differently than other layers.

     * @remarks
     * Layers are named in a tree structure, with dot separated paths (including
     * the empty path for the implicit top layer, and "(anonymous X)" for anonymous
     * layers). They are sorted in depth-first postfix traversal order. The relative
     * order of siblings is **reverse** the declaration order. Thus, layer with important
     * declarations win if they come earlier (larger order), while layer with normal
     * declarations win if the come later (smaller absolute order, but normal layers have
     * negative order).
     *
     * Thus, in order to compare foo.bar.lorem.ipsum and foo.bar.dolor.sit, we need to
     * 1. find the common ancestor (common path), here foo.bar.
     * 2. find where the next bits (lorem / dolor) have been defined, i.e. locate
     *    foo.bar.lorem and foo.bar.dolor
     * 3. compare them according to order in the initial array, which is the declaration order.
