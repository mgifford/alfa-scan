 * This currently does not look at layout information. It probably should.
 * But texts (and elements) that are moved out of their positioning ancestors
 * could be anywhere on the page and finding the actual background requires
 * looking at potentially any element of the page. This is too complex to
 * implement before we encounter problems due to this.
