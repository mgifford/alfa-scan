/**
 * Checks if content is not visible due to being scrolled behind a parent scroll container
 * {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scroll_container}
 *
 * @remarks
 * This predicate is currently not able to detect if content is scrolled behind to the left
 * or above after the scroll position has changed. This is because we would have to differentiate
 * between content that is to the left or above when the scroll position is in its default position
 * and therefore cannot be scrolled into view, and content that is to the left or above after scrolling
 * and could be scrolled back into view.
 *
 * Usually content that can be scrolled into view is considered visible,
 * but in some instances we also want to regard such content as invisible.
 * To check for this, use (the negation of) this predicate
 * in conjunction with isVisible like in the following example.
 *
 * @example
 * const isStrictlyVisible = and(isVisible, not(isScrolledBehind));
 *
 * @public
