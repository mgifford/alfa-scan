/**
 * Check whether an `<option>` (or its descendants) is hidden in its
 * `<select>`.
 *
 * @privateRemarks
 * There is no official rule for which `<option>` is hidden inside a
 *   `<select>`,
 * and it gets tricky depending on the display size. This might be OS and UA
 * dependent.
 * From experiments on Chrome (quickly confirmed on Firefox) on Windows 11:
 * * If the `<select>` is not multiple and has display size of 1, then no
 *   `<option>` is actually shown. The `selected` (or first) `<option>` text is
 *   shown, but as the `<select>` value, not as an `<option>` (notably, it is
 *   styled through the `select` selector, not `option`).
 * * If the `<select>` is multiple, or has a display size of d>1, then d
 *   options are shown. They include the first `selected` option, and the
 *   previous ones, until d are found or the first is reached, and the
 *   following ones until d `<option>` are shown. If there are less than d
 *   `<option>`, this is completed with empty lines (styled as `select`, not as
 *   `option`).
 *
 * What is somewhat better, is that the boundingClientRect seem to be correctly
 * set. That is, in the first case above the `<option>` have a client rect of
 * `{ x:0, y:0, width:0, height:0 }`, while in the second case they have a
 *   non-0
 * one. The hidden `<option>` still have a non-0 client rect which is clipped
 * by the `<select>` client rect. So we can rely on that when layout
 *   information
 * is available.
 *
 * Note that styling the `<select>` to increase its `height` may break this
 * heuristic…
