/**
 * Get content between two nodes. The relative order of the nodes is unknown.
 * Options let it choose whether the first or second node (in tree order)
 * should be included. By default, exclude both.
 *
 * When the first node is not included, all its subtree is skipped, that is we
 * start looking after the closing tag, not after the opening one.
 *
 * Returns empty sequence in the corner case where both nodes are the same and
 * at least one is excluded (i.e. considers that [X,X[ and ]X,X] are empty).
 *
 * Complexity: the size of the subtree anchored at the lowest common ancestor.
