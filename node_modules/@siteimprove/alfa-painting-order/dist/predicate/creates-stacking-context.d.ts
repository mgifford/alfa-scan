 *
 * @remarks
 * This doesn't cover the following known cases, either because we haven't
 * implemented support for the CSS property or because it's otherwise not
 * feasible to cover the case. In the future, new properties may be added that
 * also create stacking contexts. We will have to update this predicate as such
 * new properties become supported by the browsers.
 *
 * * The properties `filter`, `backdrop-filter` and `mask-border` having
 *   non-initial values: Support for the properties are not yet implemented in Alfa.
 *
 * * Elements placed into the top layer and its corresponding ::backdrop e.g.
 *   fullscreen and popover elements: It's unclear how to implement this and it's
 *   not the most important use case currently.
 *
 * * Element that has had stacking context-creating properties animated using
 *   @keyframes, with `animation-fill-mode` set to `forwards`: It's unclear how
 *   to implement this, but it is a valid case, that we should eventually support.
