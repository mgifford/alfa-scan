 * As such, it must be serializable, meaning it must not reference any external
 * file (only import type are allowed), and may not use annex functions (who
 * must instead be inlined in the main function).
 *
 * We could use Webpack or the like to bundle the current file with its
 * dependencies into a single file. This is however somewhat heavy-handed, and
 * the rest of Alfa has no need for such complex machinery, so we stick to a
 * simple solution for now.
